''' Unordered: Unordered means that the items in a set
do not have a defined order.
Set items can appear in a different order every time
you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.
Unchangeable: Set items are unchangeable, meaning that
we cannot change the items after the set has been created.
Note: Once a set is created, you cannot change its items,
but you can remove items and add new items.
Duplicates Not Allowed:
Sets cannot have two items with the same value.
